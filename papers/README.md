### protein complexes:

### how we find protein complexes:

#### [IP pull-down / tap-tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation#Individual_protein_immunoprecipitation_(IP))

*Summary From Dr. Payne: They make antibodies for hundresds of thousands of proteins. They pull out the protein that binds to the antibody gently, so they can get anything that was bound to it. They repeat it again and again*

#### [Yest-2 hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-hybrid_screening)

*Sumary From Dr. Payne: On one side of a transcription factor, they clone in protein a, and on one side of the activator they clone in protein b. If A and B intearfct, transcription should still occur. If A and B don't intearct, then no transcriptino occurs. Involves millions of libraries.*

#### RNA-Data/protein data from hudnreds of experiments

See which proteins have correlation, and you assert that they are somehow related.
