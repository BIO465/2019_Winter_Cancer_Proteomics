### protein complexes:
#### [A census of human soluble protein complexes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412010069?via%3Dihub)
Biological processes depend on the proper interaction between proteins. Proteins often interact in complexes which perform biochemical activities related to cellular homeostasis, growth, and proliferation. The human genome codes about 20,000 proteins, how these are organized into "protein machine" complexes is promising research question.

### how we find protein complexes:

#### [IP pull-down / tap-tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immunoprecipitation#Individual_protein_immunoprecipitation_(IP))

*Description from Dr. Payne: they make antibodies for hundresds of thousands of proteins. They pull out the protein that binds to the antibody gently, so they can get anything that was bound to it. They repeat it again and again*

#### [Yest-2 hybridization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-hybrid_screening)

transcription factor and its activator.

On one side of the transcription factor, they clone in protein a, and on one side of the activator they clone in protein b. If A and B intearfct, transcription should still occur. If A and B don't intearct, then no transcriptino occurs. Involves millions of libraries.

#### Bioinformatics Approach

*Summary From Dr. Payne: Scrape data from hundreds of RNA-Seq and protein abundance experiments adn search for a correlation in expression between proteins.*
